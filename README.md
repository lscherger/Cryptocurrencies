# Cryptocurrencies
unsupervised machine learning
## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to use unsupervised machine learning to cluster data into groups to discover unknown patterns in cryptocurrencies. In this project, we focused on preprocessing the data for Principal Components Analysis, performing PCA to reduce the data dimensions to relevant numeric data, clustering the data using K-Means, and visualizing the data with Plotly Express using Python. 

## Results

### Deliverable 1: Preprocessing the Data for PCA

## Summary
The final analysis displays four classes of cryptocurrencies that were divided into clusters based on their relationships between Total Coins Mined and Total Coin Supply. The results of this analysis would be useful to someone interested in investing into cryptocurrencies.
